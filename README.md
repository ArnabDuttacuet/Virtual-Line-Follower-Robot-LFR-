# Virtual-Line-Follower-Robot-LFR-
# Virtual Line-Follower Robot Simulation

This project simulates a simple **virtual line-following robot** using Python and Matplotlib. The robot (a blue circle) smoothly follows a curved black path defined by sine waves. The simulation is animated and can be exported as a GIF.

---

## Project Features

- Smooth 2D animation of a line-following robot
- Curved path created with sine wave functions
- Robot moves with real-time vector-based motion
- Saves the animation as a `.gif` using `pillow`

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow (to save the GIF)

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Animation with `FuncAnimation`
- Vector normalization and movement
- GIF creation in Python
- Simple robotics logic (waypoint tracking)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
